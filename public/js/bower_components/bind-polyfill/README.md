This repo exists in order to define a bower package (bind-polyfill), I am not the author of this code.

Taken from the fine folks at [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility). This method is also available in the broader [polyfills](https://github.com/inexorabletash/polyfill) bower package.


Not needed for IE9+, FF4+ Webkit, Chrome 12+ (_but is needed for PhantomJS_). See [ES5 Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/#Function.prototype.bind) for details. 

`bower install bind-polyfill --save`
